My name is Deborah. I'm a junior computer science major with a biblical apologetics minor. I'm also a huge Star Wars fan!! I'm brand new to open source so I am still learning what I like about it, but being able to do this makes it seem pretty cool. I think my interests are in AI, machine learning, IOT, but with little experience with those I'm not sure. But would love to find ways to be exposed to it.
